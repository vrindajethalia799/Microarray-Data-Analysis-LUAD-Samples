# Microarray-Data-Analysis-LUAD-Samples

## About
In this project, I attempted to recreate the findings of the study ‘Analysis of genes associated with prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma based on GEO and TCGA databases' by Yu et al (2020). In this study, the investigators aimed to assess potential biomarkers for the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) by the analysis of gene expression microarrays. <br>

For this project, I downloaded the ‘Series Matrix File’ from the GSE118370 dataset in the GEO Database, normalised and performed differential expression analysis using the LIMMA package in R. Further, I analysed the results using a volcano plot and a heatmap with hierarchical clustering in Python. <br>
